<p><font face="goergia" color="red">Some of the world's most elite athletes use battle ropes to isolate and tone those hard to find muscles. Specifically in the upper shoulders and lower arms.

Using this system with a strong and regular leg work out is best for an over all balanced look over time.</p>

    <h2>FREE WEIGHTS</h2>
    <img src="https://ak2.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/27010432/thumb/1.jpg?i10c=img.resize(height:165)" width="800" height="800"><P style=font-size:100% <p><font face="goergia" color="red">Muscle isolation. Times ten. Free weights allow you to pin point muscles that most machines or fixed weight stations tend to over look during a work out. Those stuborn muscles behind the upper amrs. Or mayne you can try repping sit ups with a little something extra weighing down on the chest for an added burn. Squats anyone? What ever the tool, dumbells or medicine balls, you will get the results that you desire if you put in th effort. Get to it.</p>

After a few sessions you will feel as lean as possible while gaining the cardiovascular fine tuning that your body deserves. Step up and go for it.</p>
